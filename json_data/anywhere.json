Serving Nyonya cuisine, Gene's family ran a restaurant called Nyonya Flavours in the nineties from this location. Later on, when the family retired the restaurant, it became a pub named Bulldog for a short time. Gene later took over the running of the establishment and reinstated the serving of Peranakan Chinese cuisine, but kept the pub's name. 'I wanted a name that didn't relate to Peranakan Chinese cuisine,' he says. One could say it's also an irreverent reminder of the British rule in Malaya, whom Gene's fore-fathers, the babas revered. This modern day baba takes his punk and skateboarding roots and attempts to playfully re-present Peranakan Chinese food, while keeping its essence. Gene and Tal's hope for Melaka is that the State keeps pushing for development, without losing its charm and uniqueness.",
